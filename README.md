## What This Is

Connector ID is evolving from a proof-of-concept RF connector classifier
into a production-grade identification system for RF coaxial connectors.
The goal is simple for the end user: point a camera at a connector and get
a correct, useful result.

The target result is not just one flat class label. The system should infer:

- connector family/type,
- standard vs reverse polarity,
- gender/contact configuration,
- mount style,
- orientation,
- cable termination where visible,
- size/geometry cues when a scale reference is available,
- confidence, ambiguity, and top alternatives,
- cross-referenced engineering specs.

The authoritative roadmap is:

- [`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
- [`TASKS.md`](TASKS.md)

The first implementation batch completed the repo audit and taxonomy/spec
foundation:

- [`docs/REPO_AUDIT.md`](docs/REPO_AUDIT.md)
- [`docs/CONNECTOR_TAXONOMY.md`](docs/CONNECTOR_TAXONOMY.md)
- [`training/rfconnectorai/specs/connectors.yaml`](training/rfconnectorai/specs/connectors.yaml)
- [`training/rfconnectorai/schemas/taxonomy.py`](training/rfconnectorai/schemas/taxonomy.py)

---

## Current Implementation Status

- Batches 1-10 scaffolded on `master`: taxonomy, annotation protocol,
  acceptance gates, instance schema, model registry, dataset audit,
  crop manifest, YOLO dataset builder, detector training scaffold,
  multi-head classifier scaffold, prediction response schema, evaluation
  harness, synthetic render planner, mobile/server export scaffold, and
  the demo package.
- Heavy training and rendering run in Kaggle/Colab/cloud — not on the
  local PC. Local invocation is restricted to `--dry-run`.
- Existing `/predict` compatibility is a hard constraint.
- Next: real cloud runs against the YOLO data builder + multihead
  trainer + eval harness, with results posted back into
  `reports/experiments/<run>/`.

Execution gates:
[`docs/ACCEPTANCE_GATES.md`](docs/ACCEPTANCE_GATES.md).
Labeling rulebook:
[`docs/ANNOTATION_PROTOCOL.md`](docs/ANNOTATION_PROTOCOL.md).
Client demo entry:
[`docs/CLIENT_DEMO_README.md`](docs/CLIENT_DEMO_README.md).

---

## Current Baseline

Current production behavior is preserved.

- Flutter app in `flutter/`
- FastAPI predict service in `training/rfconnectorai/server/predict_service.py`
- Existing `/predict` endpoint shape remains:

```json
{
  "image_width": 1920,
  "image_height": 1080,
  "predictions": [
    {
      "class_name": "2.4mm-M",
      "confidence": 0.83,
      "probabilities": {},
      "bbox": {"x": 612, "y": 415, "w": 240, "h": 240}
    }
  ]
}
```

Current documented model:

| Metric | v18 Baseline |
|---|---:|
| Full class accuracy | 75% |
| Family accuracy | 75% |
| Gender accuracy | 87.5% |
| Background false positives | 0% |
| Held-out size | 8 phone shots |

The current model is an ImageNet-pretrained ResNet-18 with a linear head.
The 8-image holdout is too small to support strong accuracy claims; one
miss changes accuracy by 12.5 percentage points.

ResNet-18 is now treated as the baseline and fallback, not the final
architecture. The model strategy is moving to a multi-architecture pipeline:
detector plus multi-head classifier plus geometry/spec verification. See
[`docs/MULTI_ARCHITECTURE_TRANSITION.md`](docs/MULTI_ARCHITECTURE_TRANSITION.md).

## Target Architecture

The planned production architecture is a staged computer vision pipeline:

```text
Camera frame
  -> connector/background detector
  -> connector crop or mask
  -> multi-head attribute classifier
  -> optional measurement/calibration module
  -> confidence and ambiguity logic
  -> connector spec lookup
  -> mobile/desktop result card
```

## Quick Start

### Training Package Setup

Use Python 3.11 or newer.

```bash
cd training
python -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/pip install -e ".[dev]"      # Windows
.venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev]"          # macOS/Linux
```

Run the current FastAPI predict service:

```bash
cd training
uvicorn rfconnectorai.server.predict_service:app --port 8503
```

Train the current ResNet baseline only when reproducing the current model:

```bash
cd training
python -m rfconnectorai.classifier.train \
  --data-dir data/labeled/embedder \
  --out-dir models/connector_classifier \
  --epochs 20
```

Future detector and multi-head training should be run in Kaggle, Colab, or
another cloud runtime after scripts are pushed to GitHub. This local PC is
not the target for heavy model bake-offs.

### Flutter App

```bash
cd flutter
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

The app currently provides:

- Identify: camera/photo/video prediction flow.
- About: product info, privacy, request form, dev-mode unlock.
- Contribute: dev-only training and holdout capture flow.

### Capacitor Mobile App (on-device ONNX)

A second mobile path lives in `exports/mobile/` and runs the
detector + classifier entirely on-device in a WebView via ONNX Runtime
Web. A pre-built debug APK is at `exports/mobile/dist/app-debug.apk`.

Quick install on Android:

```bash
adb install -r exports/mobile/dist/app-debug.apk
```

Full step-by-step build instructions (JDK 21 setup, Android SDK in a
writable location, license acceptance, Gradle build, USB install, iOS
on Mac) are in
[`exports/mobile/README.md`](exports/mobile/README.md).

### Diagram Rendering

Graphviz sources are committed so diagrams can be regenerated. See
[`docs/DIAGRAM_RENDERING.md`](docs/DIAGRAM_RENDERING.md) for the full set
of `dot` commands.

## Development Rules

- Do not rewrite the whole app.
- Preserve existing `/predict` behavior and Flutter screens.
- Add new structured output beside old fields, not instead of them.
- Keep spec lookup separate from model inference.
- Treat `unknown`, `unsupported`, and `need another angle` as valid outcomes.
- Treat ResNet-18 as the baseline/fallback, not the final architecture.
- Compare detector/classifier candidates in cloud runs before promoting them.
- Do not claim 99.99% accuracy without statistically meaningful validation.
- Every model improvement must include test data discipline, metrics, and
  visible failure cases.
