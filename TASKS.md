# SMA Connector AI - Development Task Blueprint

This file is the execution checklist from the current repository state to the
target multi-architecture RF connector identification system.

Core rules:

- Preserve existing Flutter and FastAPI behavior.
- Preserve `/predict` compatibility.
- Treat ResNet-18 as baseline/fallback, not the final architecture.
- Build detector + multi-head classifier + geometry/spec verification.
- Run heavy model training and bake-offs in Kaggle/Colab/cloud, not on the
  local PC.
- Keep local and GitHub `master` synced after each completed batch.

## Legend

- `P0` = required immediately
- `P1` = required for demo-quality implementation
- `P2` = production hardening
- `P3` = advanced/future enhancement

Status values:

- `[ ]` not started
- `[~]` in progress
- `[x]` done
- `[!]` blocked

The cloud bake-off must run the full pytest suite, then run real
detector/classifier training on Kaggle/Colab. Local PCs only `--dry-run`.

## Execution Batch 2 - Dataset Audit and Schema Foundations

Implement Epic 2 plus the schema foundations needed before crops are
generated. Targets gate `G1 - Dataset Readiness` plus partial `G2`.

Scope:

1. `docs/ANNOTATION_PROTOCOL.md` (already authored - confirm and link).
2. `docs/ACCEPTANCE_GATES.md` (already authored - confirm and link).
3. `training/rfconnectorai/schemas/instance.py` (already authored - add
   tests for schema validation, including adapter rules).
4. `training/rfconnectorai/data/audit.py` plus CLI:

   ```bash
   python -m rfconnectorai.data.audit --data-dir data --out docs/DATASET_AUDIT.md
   ```

5. The audit must support:
   - `training/Images`
   - `training/data/labeled`
   - `training/data/test_holdout`
   - `training/data/reference`
   - `training/data/videos`
6. The audit must report:
   - image counts by folder/class,
   - file type and dimensions,
   - unreadable/corrupt files,
   - duplicates by hash,
   - likely synthetic vs real from path/name metadata,
   - likely multi-connector images (lightweight heuristics only),
   - missing taxonomy classes,
   - classes below target sample count,
   - train/val/test/holdout leakage risks.
7. Add JSON output beside markdown if practical:
   `docs/DATASET_AUDIT.json`.
8. Add tests for:
   - instance schema validation,
   - audit utility functions using tiny temp fixtures,
   - audit CLI dry run or fixture run.

Constraints:

- Do not modify or move original images.
- Do not train models.
- Do not change existing `/predict` behavior.
- Do not rewrite the Flutter app.
- Do not add GPU-only dependencies.
- Preserve all current tests.

Return:

- files changed
- generated audit summary
- commands run
- cloud/local environment used
- test results or blockers
- next recommended batch
